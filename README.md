A robust Java application demonstrating **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. This project allows users to load geometric shape data from files, visualize them dynamically on a responsive interface, and perform calculations like surface area reporting.

## 📌 Key Features

* **Dynamic Visualization:**
    * Shapes are drawn on a custom `DrawingPanel`.
    * **Responsive Layout:** Shapes automatically wrap to new lines and center themselves based on the window size.
    * **Scroll Support:** Handles large numbers of shapes using a smooth scroll view.
* **File Processing:**
    * Parses text files to load shape data (Circles, Cubes, etc.).
    * Generates and saves detailed text reports for area calculations.
* **OOP Design:**
    * Utilizes **Polymorphism** and **Interfaces** (`Drawable`) to manage different shapes uniformly.
    * Clean separation of concerns between Logic and GUI.
* **User Interface:**
    * Interactive Dashboard with options to Load, Calculate, Save, and View.
    * Real-time feedback and validation messages.

* **Concepts:**
    * Inheritance & Polymorphism
    * Interfaces (`Drawable`)
    * File I/O (Reading/Writing streams)
    * Layout Managers

## 📝 Input File Format

To test the application, create a text file (e.g., `shapes.txt`) with the following format (adjust based on your parser logic):

```text
Circle 50
Cube 100
Circle 75
Cube 60
```

## 🔮 Future Improvements
1.  **Add support for more shapes (Triangles, Rectangles).**
  
2.  **Implement color customization for each shape.**
    
3.  **Database integration for saving shape history.**
